# Beyond The Move : An Explainable AI (XAI) Framework for Cognitive Skill Acquisition in the Game of Go
## Project Overview
Beyond The Move (BM) is an ongoing research project exploring how Explainable AI (XAI) methods can be applied to strategic games—starting with the game of Go—to generate human-like move recommendations and interpretable explanations. The project is currently in active development.
## Research Question
 How can Explainable AI methods be used to make AI move recommendations in strategy games more interpretable and human-like?
