# Beyond The Move : An Explainable AI (XAI) Framework for Cognitive Skill Acquisition in the Game of Go
## Project Overview
    Beyond The Move (BM) is an ongoing research project exploring how Explainable AI (XAI) methods can be applied to strategic games—starting with the game of Go—to generate human-like move recommendations and interpretable explanations. The project is currently in active development.
## Research Question
    -- How can Explainable AI methods be used to make AI move recommendations in strategy games more interpretable and human-like?
## Research Goal
    -- To create a "Glass Box" AI that visualizes its strategic reasoning, helping human players improve their intuition rather than just memorizing computer moves. Create an XAI model that teachs rredarr than compete.
## Project Timeline
    Phase I: CNN, "Professional Mimic" —a system that has excellent intuition (Shape/Direction of Play) but limited calculation (Reading deep fights). (Current Phase) 
    Phase II:
    Phase III:
